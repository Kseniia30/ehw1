        <h1 class="top-text">Topic: Apple</h1>
        <p class="text">Apple is a world-renowned for the technology they create.  In 2018, it took third place in the list of the 500 best employers in the world according to Forbes magazine. In a 2022 Apple became the first company in the world to reach a market cap of $3 trillion. </p>
        <p class="text">Their range is concludes the telephones (iPhone), computers (iPad,MacBook,iMac), accessories (apple watch. Apple card, AirPods) ets.</p>

            <li class="list-item"><img src="img/iphone.jpg" alt="iphone" height="100"></li>

            <li class="list-item list-item-last"><img src="img/watch.jpg" alt="apple watch" height="100"></li>
        </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="why" class="what-can-i container">
            <p class="text">I would work for them following their values because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="text">- I believe that if you doing something small working in the team together you can make a large complex;</li>
                <li class="text">- with my own expertise I understand how important to ensure growth in your own significant contribution (“it is better to become grate in one field of activity than be good in many of it”, “it is better spend time for making one project an ideal, develop it and improve, than just force to work a lot of them”).</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">I can contribute to the company my soft skills (I can find a common language with any person, I can inspire team to work harder, I can become an example of hardworking and passionate, I can take the initiative), my skills to make everything to get the purpose.</p>
            <p class="text">I want to work with Apple because I am sure that with their specialization I will push my own boundaries in knowledge of phone- and computer technology.</p>
            <p class="text">The most important for me in a job it’s not to stay on one place, I need to develop my own skills, to make something important, to be useful. I can adjust to any kind of conditions, I want to have a worthy salary, but first of all I need to implement technologies and make it better for users.</p>
